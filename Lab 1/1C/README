This project includes:
lab1c.c: A simple linux shell that allows users to pass in commands and do file input-output via system calls as a normal C file would do, but in the form of UNIX.
Makefile: A general file that builds simpsh from lab1c.c. Additionally, this file contains options to "check", which runs smoke tests and reports whether or not it was a success, a "clean", which removes all files not to be compressed into tarball, and a "dist" to build and compress lab1b.c, README, and the makefile into a tarball for submission.

Smoke Tests:
For this project, I have included a test for each exit code that I have used to ensure proper software usage:
rdonly: testing basic read only. This is just a general test to make sure the file would be able to open properly.
rdonlyF: testing failure of file open. This test tested on a file that would not exist in the program and would result in a failure return code. 
wronly: testing basic wronly. This is just a general test to make sure the file would be able to open properly.
wronlyF: testing failure of file open. This test tested on a file that would not exist in the program and would result in a failure return code. 
verbose: testing verbose feature. This test only checks on whether or not the lab properly had.
command: Simple ensuring command works properly.
flag: Testing flags if they can work well.
abort: Ensuring abort actually aborts with proper values

Struggles of the project:
I had most difficulty coming up with possible test cases for the testing and ensuring testing was run fairly.
