This project includes:
lab1a.c: C source code that currently takes 4 arguments. --rdonly and --wronly opens files for reading and writing respectively. --command allows users to issue commands which then get translated into system calls. --verbose gives users a list of their arguments and each parameter for said argument.
Makefile: A general file that builds lab1a from lab1b.c. Additionally, this file contains options to "check", which runs smoke tests and reports whether or not it was a success, a "clean", which removes all files not to be compressed into tarball, and a "dist" to build and compress lab1a.c, README, and the makefile into a tarball for submission.
Smoke Tests:
For this project, I have included a test for each exit code that I have used to ensure proper software usage:
rdonly: testing basic read only. This is just a general test to make sure the file would be able to open properly.
rdonlyF: testing failure of file open. This test tested on a file that would not exist in the program and would result in a failure return code. 
wronly: testing basic wronly. This is just a general test to make sure the file would be able to open properly.
wronlyF: testing failure of file open. This test tested on a file that would not exist in the program and would result in a failure return code. 
verbose: testing verbose feature. This test only checks on whether or not the lab properly had.
command: Simple ensuring command works properly.

Struggles of the project:
In this project, I had the most trouble with getting proper usage of software. I found it difficult to understand command completely, and got stumped mostly on that section. I was not sure on how to formulate a proper solution in that area at first, but found it slowly.
